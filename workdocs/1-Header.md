## Typed Object Accumulator

Typed Object Accumulator is a TypeScript library that provides a type-safe way to dynamically accumulate and manage object properties. It allows you to combine multiple objects while maintaining full TypeScript type information, giving you the flexibility of dynamic objects with the safety of static typing. The library is designed to be immutable, chainable, and fully type-aware, making it ideal for building complex objects incrementally in a type-safe manner.
